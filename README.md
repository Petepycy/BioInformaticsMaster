Somatic variant detection
In oncology related applications sometimes (mainly limited by cost and availability) paired
tumor-normal analysis is conducted. DNA samples from both tumor and healthy tissue are
sequenced and the analysis is focused on detecting variants (mutations) present only in
tumor. Detected mutations may be used to guide further clinical management of the patient.
This analysis is focused on SNP variants to limit the scope of the project.
A good starting point may be the following work:
https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-020-00791-w
Additional materials will be available online. Feel free to consult with me if you have
questions about the project.
Tasks to perform:
● learn the basics of the variant calling problem
● download data from
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA284596
select one of the available patients
● Allign the reads to the reference genome Grch38
● Call variant
● Use
https://www.cancergenomeinterpreter.org/
to interpret the variants
● Present a brief overview of the results and upload scripts to the github repository
